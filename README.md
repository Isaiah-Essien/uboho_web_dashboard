## Uboho App


**Uboho** is a real-time mobile monitoring application designed for individuals living with epilepsy. It passively captures motion and rotation data using smartphone sensors, applies AI-based seizure detection models, and connects patients to healthcare providers through real-time alerts, communication, and remote monitoring.

---


## AI Model

The app integrates an on-device seizure detection model:

- **Model Type**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or CNN + LSTM
- **Input Features**: Accelerometer and gyroscope sequences in fixed windows
- **Output**: Binary classification (Seizure or Non-seizure)
- **Deployment**: TensorFlow Lite model integrated in the app for low-latency inference

The model is trained offline using labeled motion data and updated as part of app upgrades.

---

## Emergency Workflow

1. Seizure-like activity is detected.
2. An alert is triggered within the app.
3. Current location is captured.
4. Alert and location are sent to the doctor‚Äôs dashboard.
5. Doctor receives real-time notification and patient status.

---

## Doctor Dashboard

Data is passed from the App to the hospital or doctor's dashboard via firebase on a web-based platform built with React and Firebase. Doctors can:

- View assigned patient profiles and motion history
- Receive real-time alerts when a seizure is detected
- View patient location on seizure events
- Chat with patients in need
- Manage accounts and monitor patient compliance

Each doctor receives a unique login ID and patients are automatically linked upon account creation.
